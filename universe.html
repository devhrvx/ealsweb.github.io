                The Steady-State Theory is a theoretical model in which the Universe is constantly expanding but with a fixed average density.
                <br><br> In this Universe model, matter is always created to form galaxies and stars at the same speed as the old ones become destroyed.
                <br> Their relative distances and recession velocity increase to nullify the overall change in the density. <br> <br> There is no overall beginning or end for a steady-state Universe. When we take any point within view on a grand scale, the overall average density and order of galaxies are always the same. In this model, the matter density in the expanding space-time stays constant as a reason for the ceaseless creation of matter. Thus, acting as an ideal principle suggests that the visible Universe is physically the same at any place and time.
