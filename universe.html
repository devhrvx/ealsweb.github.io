            <div class="box-content"> 
                The Steady-State Theory is a theoretical model in which the Universe is constantly expanding but with a fixed average density.
                <br><br> In this Universe model, matter is always created to form galaxies and stars at the same speed as the old ones become destroyed.
                <br> Their relative distances and recession velocity increase to nullify the overall change in the density. <br> <br> There is no overall beginning or end for a steady-state Universe. When we take any point within view on a grand scale, the overall average density and order of galaxies are always the same. In this model, the matter density in the expanding space-time stays constant as a reason for the ceaseless creation of matter. Thus, acting as an ideal principle suggests that the visible Universe is physically the same at any place and time.

        <div class="ppl-1"><span id="h-p">Hermann Bondi</span><br><br><br><br>Hermann Bondi (born on November 1, 1919, in Vienna Austria, He died on September 10, 2005, in Cambridge England) he is an austrian mathematician and cosmologist Who is known for creating the steady state theory with Fred Hoyle and Thomas Gold as an replacement to Big Bang Theory.<br><br>He is the first one to came up with inertia and gravitational and interaction of negative mass.
            Bondi considered the 1962 <i>Gravitational Waves</i> as his "best scientific work".

        <div class="ppl-2"><span id="h-p">Fred Hoyle</span><br><br><br><br>Fred Hoyle (born June 24, 1915, Bingley, Yorkshire , died on August 20, 2001, Bournemouth, Dorset). Hoyle is a British mathematician and astronomer who calculated the stellar nucleosynthesis. <br><br>Hoyle is the one to defend The Steady-State Theory; this theory holds <i>"both that the universe is expanding and that matter is being continuously created."</i> After the things he did Fred Hoyle has been a significant person in astrophysics and cosmology.

        <div class="ppl-3"><span id="h-p">Thomas Gold</span><br><br><br><br>Thomas Gold (born May 22, 1920, Vienna, Austria, died June 22, 2004, Ithaca, New York, U.S.) he is a astrophysicist, a professor of astronomy at Cornell University, a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and a Fellow of the Royal Society. <br><br> His most helpful research in The Steady-State Theory is the conducted research on pulsars, neutron stars, and the interstellar medium. After that his curiosity continued to inspire other astronomers and astrophysicists.
