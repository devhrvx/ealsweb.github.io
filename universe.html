            <div class="box-content"> 
                The Steady-State Theory is a theoretical model in which the Universe is constantly expanding but with a fixed average density.
                <br><br> In this Universe model, matter is always created to form galaxies and stars at the same speed as the old ones become destroyed.
                <br> Their relative distances and recession velocity increase to nullify the overall change in the density. <br> <br> There is no overall beginning or end for a steady-state Universe. When we take any point within view on a grand scale, the overall average density and order of galaxies are always the same. In this model, the matter density in the expanding space-time stays constant as a reason for the ceaseless creation of matter. Thus, acting as an ideal principle suggests that the visible Universe is physically the same at any place and time.

            <div class="pulsating-text">The pulsating Universe theory, a variation of the Big Bang theory, in which the Universe goes through successive periods of expansion and contraction once all the energy after the Big Bang is used up. <br><br> At the end of the compression stage, when the Universe is concentrated in a small volume of high density, there is a "break up" the Universe, called a bang. Pulsating theory states that it is the possibility that after some passage of time the expansion in the universe may stop. <br><br>This theory, proposed by Richard Tolman, can be described as the combination of the Big Bang Theory and the Big Crunch Theory. </div>

            <div class="box-title-2">The Big Bang Theory</div>
            <div class="box-content-2"> 
                The most popular theory of our universe's origin, Big Bang. This theory was discovered by Georges Lema√Ætre in 1920s, he said that the universe started at a single point, and it stretched and expanded to get as big as it is now. When the universe began, it was compressed into a hot, dense mass, and full of tiny particles mixed with light and energy, until everything expanded and it cooled down. The atoms started to form from the tiny particles, and over lots of time atoms started to construct stars and galaxies. 
                <br><br>
                Edwin Hubble observed that the expansion has apparently continued, and that means if things were moving apart, it meant that a very long time ago, everything had been close together.
                <br><br>
                Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) the evidence that supported the big bang, was discovered by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, it is a leftover light or radiation, and it represents the heat remainder from the big bang. As the universe expanded, it got to the point where it became transparent to light and radiation. This lights travelled and got stretched out because of the universe's expansion. CMB can't be seen with a naked eye, but it is everywhere in the universe. It is also very consistent, all the direction it goes to almost have the same temperature, with only tiny variations.
