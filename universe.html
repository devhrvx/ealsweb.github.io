            It states that the counting of the galaxies in our

            Universe is constant and new galaxies which are

            forming continuously are filling the empty spaces

            which are created by those heavenly bodies

            which have crossed the boundary lines of

            observable Universe.

            The theory was first put forward in 1948 by

            British scientists <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hermann-Bondi">Sir Hermann Bondi</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Gold">Thomas

            Gold</a>, and <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fred-Hoyle">Sir Fred Hoyle</a>. It was further

            developed by Hoyle to deal with problems that

            had arisen in connection with the alternative big-
            bang hypothesis.
