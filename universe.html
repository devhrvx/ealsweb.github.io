            <div class="box-content"> 
                The Steady-State Theory is a theoretical model in which the Universe is constantly expanding but with a fixed average density.
                <br><br> In this Universe model, matter is always created to form galaxies and stars at the same speed as the old ones become destroyed.
                <br> Their relative distances and recession velocity increase to nullify the overall change in the density. <br> <br> There is no overall beginning or end for a steady-state Universe. When we take any point within view on a grand scale, the overall average density and order of galaxies are always the same. In this model, the matter density in the expanding space-time stays constant as a reason for the ceaseless creation of matter. Thus, acting as an ideal principle suggests that the visible Universe is physically the same at any place and time.

            Bondi considered the 1962 <i>Gravitational Waves</i> as his "best scientific work".

Hoyle is a British mathematician and astronomer who calculated the stellar nucleosynthesis. <br><br>Hoyle is the one to defend The Steady-State Theory; this theory holds <i>"both that the universe is expanding and that matter is being continuously created."</i> After the things he did Fred Hoyle has been a significant person in astrophysics and cosmology.

After that his curiosity continued to inspire other astronomers and astrophysicists.

            <div class="pulsating-text">The pulsating Universe theory, a variation of the Big Bang theory, in which the Universe goes through successive periods of expansion and contraction once all the energy after the Big Bang is used up. <br><br> At the end of the compression stage, when the Universe is concentrated in a small volume of high density, there is a "break up" the Universe, called a bang. Pulsating theory states that it is the possibility that after some passage of time the expansion in the universe may stop. <br><br>This theory, proposed by Richard Tolman, can be described as the combination of the Big Bang Theory and the Big Crunch Theory. </div>
