            <div class="box-content"> <p> The Steady-State Theory is a theoretical model in which the Universe is constantly expanding but with a fixed average density. In this Universe model, matter is always created to form galaxies and stars at the same speed as the old ones become destroyed. Their relative distances and recession velocity increase to nullify the overall change in the density. There is no overall beginning or end for a steady-state Universe. When we take any point within view on a grand scale, the overall average density and order of galaxies are always the same. In this model, the matter density in the expanding space-time stays constant as a reason for the ceaseless creation of matter. Thus, acting as an ideal principle suggests that the visible Universe is physically the same at any place and time.
